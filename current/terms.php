Policies apply automatically to all HostNext clients upon subscription to the Services including subscription through a third party, any commercial partner, through HostNext website, physical order form or telephone call.

This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the products and services purchased or accessed through the HostNext website (individually and collectively, the "Services").

If you do not agree to any term of this Agreement, you must notify HostNext immediately as stated herein and cease use of all Services within 24 hours of such notification.



</p><h2>NOTWITHSTANDING</h2>

<p>BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN AS WELL AS ALL POLICIES AND AGREEMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

HostNext may modify this Agreement, any Addendum, policy or guideline incorporated by reference from time to time, with or without notice, and to determine whether and when any such changes apply to both existing and/or future Customers, at its sole discretion. Any such modifications will be effective as of the date the revised Agreements, policies or guidelines are posted on the HostNext website. Your continued use of Services after such modification shall be deemed to be your acceptance of any such modifications. Modifications to this Agreement shall not be construed as cause for early termination or non-payment. It is your responsibility to review the “Legal Agreements and Policies” page on the HostNext website on a regular basis to determine whether this Agreement has been modified. If you do not agree to any modification of this Agreement, you must notify HostNext immediately as stated herein and cease use of all Services within 24 hours of such notification.</p>


<h2>Term and Payment for Services</h2>

<p>This agreement becomes effective as of the date Service is ordered (the "Initial Term"), whether such order is placed via the HostNext website, physical order form or telephone call, for the period indicated on such order.  This Agreement will be renewed automatically for another period of same duration (the "Renewal Term"), unless Customer notifies HostNext as stated herein 5 days prior to the end of Initial Term or Renewal Term (the "Service Period").</p>


<h3>Renewals, Termination and Refund Policy</h3>

<p>

Customer may cancel Customer’s use of Service at any timeren before the end of the Service Period, but at no time will HostNext be required to issue a refund if such cancellation occurs after the first 30 days of the Initial Term.  If Customer cancels use of Service within the first 30 days of the Initial Term, Customer is entitled to a refund equal to any amount paid in advance for Service, less any applicable Setup Fees or Domain Registration Fees, even if such fees were initially waived.  Notice of cancellation must be submitted to HostNext.  Even after cancellation of Service, this Agreement will remain in force until the end of the Service Period.  HostNext may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason by providing Customer written notice 24 hours prior to the date of termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, HostNext may terminate this Agreement immediately, in its sole judgment, due to Customer’s breach of any term of this Agreement, Addendums, policies or guidelines, including but not limited to refusal or failure to pay for Services in full, engaging in unlawful activities or activities harmful to any of HostNext’s other customers, employees, vendors, business relationships or any other Internet user.

</p><p>Should termination occur for such reasons prior to the end of the current Service Period, Customer understands that no refund will be issued; it is difficult or impossible to ascertain damages caused by Customer's actions which caused such termination and therefore, Customer agrees to pay the balance for the remaining Service Period as liquidated damages.  The payment of these damages by Customer in no way limits Customer's responsibility under this Agreement for Customer's action that triggered Customer's immediate termination.</p>

Regardless of Customer’s country of origin, Customer will be billed in U.S. Dollars and agrees to make payments in U.S. Dollars.

Customer agrees to pay all invoices for Services by due date in full; if payment isn’t made before due date account password will be locked on due date, if payment isn't made within 5 days of due date, a late fee of 15% or $10.00 (whichever is greater) may be applied to balance and/or Services suspended at HostNext’s sole discretion. If payment isn’t made within 10 days of due date, it will be considered a material breach of this Agreement and HostNext may, in addition to any other remedy it may have, suspend its performance of the Services and/or terminate this agreement and delete any and all Customer data from its servers. Any such suspension or termination of the Services will not relieve Customer of obligation to pay past due fees and interest.
